# Projet Culturel 


## Why will you do this project? (Purpose)

Part of language learning is broadening your cultural understanding of the people who communicate with it. This cultural project gives you the opportunity to dig deeper in a cultural aspect of the French and Francophone world that you would like to explore. 

In your e-portfolio journal you have already explored a few cultural aspects: gastronomy, fashion, personal & scientific achievement, feminism, transportation, technological innovation, advertising.    

Now it is time to connect the dots. Can you relate any the above cultural aspects to you your own personal or academic interests? Tackle this project as an opportunity to conflate what you already care about, with what you have learned so far in this class. 

## How will you proceed? (Method)

For this project you will pair-up with a partner. Coordinate with your partner, and meet at your convenience (outside of class) to brainstorm, decide and research, on a topic you both want to explore. Ask questions (challenge cultural stereotypes). Be curious (look at it from different perspectives). Take notes (they will come handy during the reflection part). 

It is preferable to dedicate several meetings to finalize your project. As you put the pieces together pay attention to details. How every piece (be it an image or a background color of your slides, font etc) you choose to keep or discard affect your project? How do these pieces affect the idea you want to convey?  

## Outcome 
The final product of your project can be a video, a poster, or a power point presentation. You will post it on your e-portfolio and you will present it, orally in class, at the end of the semester. [DUE DATE]


## Rationale & reflection 

On your e-portfolio you will post a brief accompanying text reflecting on: 

+ Why did you choose this topic? (relevance to you and to others)
+ What medium did you choose to present it and why? (power point, video, poster) 
+ Reflections on the process: 
  + How was the collaboration?  
  + Did you have any shortcomings and or a-ha moments?   
  + What did you learn by doing this project? 
  + What advice would you give to a future student who would want to work on a similar project?  
+ Does the final project meet your personal quality standards? (content, organization, presentation)
